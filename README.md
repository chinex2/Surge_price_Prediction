# Surge_price_Prediction
After analyzing a data set of surges that occured between a certain timeline and putting it through several data preparations to create a model that will learn from this data set and be able to predict future surges in prices, I created this app with streamlit that uses the machine learning model i trained with the data set to give drivers insight.
